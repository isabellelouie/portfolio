                <h2 class="h2-sm">CONTEXT</h2>
                <p><a href="https://bonusbakery.com/" target="_blank">Bonus Bakery</a> is a plant-based bakery in
                    Vancouver, BC. My team and I evaluated their website and created an interactive prototype with
                    recommendations to optimize their online ordering process. This project was completed as part of a
                    senior level design evaluation course at Simon Fraser University.</p>

                <h2 class="h2-sm">ROLE</h2>
                <p>As a UX Researcher, I conducted heuristic evaluations, usability testing, and affinity diagramming to
                    identify customers' needs and pain points, which were then addressed in the website redesign.</p>

                <h2 class="h2-sm">OUTCOME</h2>
                <p class="no-pad">Since the completion of this project, Bonus Bakery has implemented several of our
                    recommendations, including a simplified flavour selection process and a more straightforward
                    checkout page.</p>

                <p> This project was also featured in the <a

                <h2 class="heading">The Challenge</h2>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Managing multiple ordering channels creates extra work and stress for a small business
                    owner</h3>

                <p>In our initial meeting, our client explained that orders came from various channels,
                    including their website, Instagram messages, text messages, and recurring wholesale
                    orders.</p>

                <p>These channels required the owner to manually enter data into a spreadsheet, send order
                    information to their bakers and delivery drivers, and send order confirmation messages
                    to customers.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="grid case-body one two">
            <div>
                <h2 class="heading">The Opportunity</h2>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>How might we create a robust online experience to streamline orders through a single platform?</h3>

                <p>With the multi-channel strategy hindering the company's scalability due to its reliance on manual
                    processes, our client expressed an interest in streamlining orders through the website.</p>

                <p>However, our client had been receiving complaints that customers were facing multiple
                    issues with the site, interferring with their ability to place orders.</p>

                <!-- Common complaints included
                    being able to place orders after the daily deadline and subsequently having their order cancelled
                    and not receiving a payment confirmation. -->

                <p>To better understand customers' pain points, our team decided to evaluate the design and structure of
                    the website's online ordering process to identify sources of friction and areas for improvement.</p>
            </div>
        </section>


        <section class="grid case-body one two">
            <div>
                <h2 class="heading">The Plan</h2>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Our team used three methods to assess the website: heuristic evaluations, an online customer
                    feedback survey, and think-aloud usability studies.</h3>

                <p>This provided insight from three perspectives: current Bonus Bakery customers, prospective customers
                    who had never interacted with the company before, and our team of designers.</p>

                <!-- <p>While the customer feedback survey allowed our team to collect a large number of
                    responses in a short amount of time, the usability studies offered deeper, more nuanced insights
                    from a smaller participant group.</p> -->

                <p>This approach allowed our team to pinpoint critical usability issues, common pain points, and deeply
                    understand customers' ordering behaviors and preferences. Based on our research, our team then
                    developed a list of recommendations and created a high-fidelity prototype of a new design that would
                    better address customers’ needs.

            <div>
                <p>Guided by <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Jakob Nielsen’s 10
                        interaction design principles</a>, <mark>I conducted a heuristic evaluation of the
                        Bonus Bakery website</mark>, focusing on the process of ordering a single product for delivery
                    and in-store
                    pickup. My complete heuristic evaluation report can be found <a
                        href="files/HeuristicEvaluation_BonusBakery.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <!-- <p> For each issue identified, I noted which
                    heuristic was violated, the severity of the issue, and potential solutions. Issues with a severity
                    rating of 3 or 4 were more critical as they hindered the user’s ability to complete tasks and were
                    therefore a higher priority. These ratings later guided our redesign process as they allowed our
                    team to address critical issues first, given the time constraints of our project.</p> -->

                    thoughts out loud as they completed them. Each task required participants to identify a product that
                    fulfilled the needs of a given scenario and to go through the ordering process until they reached
                    the checkout page.</p>

                    This project provided an excellent opportunity to explore a variety of UX research methodologies
                    and
                    develop my skills in designing and conducting usability studies. Analyzing, synthesizing, and
                    integrating research findings into data-driven design solutions was another key aspect of my
                    learning experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One significant takeaway was the critical role of participant selection in ensuring the
                    reliability
                    of insights. Implementing a rigorous participant screening process and balancing participant
                    demographics across user groups enhanced the credibility of our research outcomes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our final deliverables were well-received by the client, and several of our recommendations were
                    swiftly integrated post-project completion, validating the impact of our research on the design
                    process.
